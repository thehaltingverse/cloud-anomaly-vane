# 🌫️ cloud-anomaly-vane

*A poetic + philosophical exploration of machine learning for anomaly detection in cloud environments.*

---

## 📚 Overview

`cloud-anomaly-vane` is an open-ended machine learning project investigating anomalous patterns in cloud computing environments. The goal is to explore different algorithms and perspectives on what it means for behavior to "deviate" — not only in a technical sense, but in a conceptual one.

This project serves as a creative and technical sandbox for experimentation, modularization, and reflection on what anomaly detection *could* mean in complex, noisy systems.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Explore and compare anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, One-Class SVM, etc.)
- Develop a flexible pipeline for ingesting, processing, and modeling cloud-related metrics
- Reflect philosophically on "normalcy" and how we define it through models
- Build a maintainable, scalable codebase for continued exploration
